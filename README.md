# Quoridor — project workspace

This repository contains the Quoridor game project. It is organized as two separate repositories (frontend and backend) in this workspace for initial development.

See each folder for more details:

- `backend/` — Node.js + TypeScript server, Socket.IO, game engine and bot workers.
- `frontend/` — React + TypeScript client (Vite).

Follow the per-service READMEs to get started locally.
